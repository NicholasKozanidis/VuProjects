# Computer Networks Chat Client Assignment

Implement your solution in ClientStub.java.

## How to hand in
Hand in the zip file (submission.zip) created by executing `create_archive.sh`
(On Linux) or `create_archive.bat` on Windows. If you cannot execute the
`create_archive` script, please hand in a ZIP file containing
`ClientStub.java`, `run.sh`, `compile.sh` in the top-level directory.

## How to run shell scripts
Although you don't need to compile the program from the command line (usually
your IDE compiles everything automatically), it is a good idea to check that
your submission compiles before handing it in. Please run the shell script
`compile.sh` to check that your submission compiles.


The shell scripts `run.sh` and `compile.sh` can be run using any standard UNIX
shell. If you are on Windows, you can run them by following [this
tutorial](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about)

Please remember to remove any package deifinitions that your IDE may add to
`ClientStub.java`.
